# pyeurlex package

pyeurlex package to create a query for the EU SPARQL endpoint, run the query and download data

Inspired by the  R based eurlex package, which helped a lot with the SPARQL construction and understanding and general inspiration.
There is also https://github.com/seljaseppala/eu_corpus_compiler (and others) but that also only does regulatory/legislative documents.
